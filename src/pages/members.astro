/**
 * =============================================================================
 * MEMBERS PAGE - MAIN DISPLAY CONTROLLER
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * This page serves as the main orchestrator for displaying all club members.
 * It imports data and components from the modular structure we've built.
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è  ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
 * - Data: Imported from src/data/members.ts (easy to edit member info)
 * - Utilities: Imported from src/utils/memberUtils.ts (sorting and logic)
 * - Components: Uses src/components/MemberCard.astro (individual card display)
 * - Layout: Uses standard Layout wrapper with Section component
 * 
 * üéØ WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * 1. Imports member data and utility functions
 * 2. Sorts members by role priority within each academic year
 * 3. Renders year headers and member card grids
 * 4. Provides a call-to-action section at the bottom
 * 
 * üîß FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS:
 * - To add members: Edit src/data/members.ts
 * - To change card styling: Edit src/components/MemberCard.astro  
 * - To modify sorting: Edit src/utils/memberUtils.ts
 * - To change page layout: Edit this file
 * 
 * üí° TESTING CHANGES:
 * - Run `npm run dev` and visit /members
 * - Check that sorting is correct within each year
 * - Verify special effects work on president cards
 * - Ensure responsive design works on mobile
 * =============================================================================

// Data and Business Logic
import { membersByYear } from "@/data/members";

// Sort all members by their role priority within each academic year
// This ensures Presidents appear first, then VPs, then other roles
