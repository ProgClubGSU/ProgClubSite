 * MEMBER UTILITY FUNCTIONS
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * This file contains all the helper functions for managing and displaying 
 * member data. These utilities handle role checking, sorting, and content
 * generation for the members page.
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¯ MAIN FUNCTIONS:
 * - isPresidentRole() - Check if someone gets special sparkle effects
 * - isFoundingPresident() - Check if someone gets EXTRA special effects  
 * - getRolePriority() - Determine sorting order within each year
 * - sortMembersByRole() - Sort all members for display
 * - getPlaceholderDescription() - Generate fallback text
 * 
 * ðŸ”§ FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS:
 * - Add new special roles to getRolePriority()
 * - Modify sparkle effects logic in isPresidentRole()
 * - Update placeholder text in getPlaceholderDescription()
 * 
 * ðŸ’¡ TESTING CHANGES:
 * - Run `npm run dev` and check /members page
 * - Verify sorting is correct within each year section
 * - Check that special effects work on president cards

 *

 * Determines the priority order for sorting members within each academic year

 * - Lower numbers = displayed first (higher priority)
 * - Presidents always appear at the top
 * - Founding roles get special priority treatment  
 * - Executive roles come before general members
 * 
 * ðŸ”§ HOW TO ADD NEW ROLES:
 * 1. Add the role name to the priorities object below
 * 2. Assign it a priority number (1 = highest, 99+ = lowest)
 * 3. Members will automatically sort correctly
 * 
 * @param role - The member's role string
 * @returns Priority number (1 = highest priority, 99+ = lowest priority)
 * 
 * @example
 * getRolePriority("President")         // 1 - appears first
 * getRolePriority("Vice President")    // 4 - appears after advisors  
 * getRolePriority("Member")           // 11 - appears last
 * getRolePriority("Unknown Role")     // 99 - default for unknown roles
