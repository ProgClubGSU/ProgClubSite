# Notion Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Notion integration for your club website.

## üéØ **Overview**

Your club officers can now add events and resources directly in Notion, and they'll automatically sync to your website every 6 hours.

## üìã **Step 1: Create Notion Database**

1. **Go to [notion.so](https://notion.so)** and create a new page
2. **Add a database** by typing `/database` and selecting "Table"

| **Date** | Date | ‚úÖ | Event date |
| **Description** | Text | ‚úÖ | Event description |
| **Slug** | Text | ‚úÖ | URL slug (e.g., "python-workshop") |
| **Status** | Select | ‚úÖ | Draft/Published |
| **Resources** | Multi-select | ‚ùå | Video, Slides, Recording, Article |
| **ResourceURLs** | Text | ‚ùå | URLs separated by commas |

### **Status Options:**
- `Draft` - Not published yet
- `Published` - Will appear on website

## üîë **Step 2: Get Notion API Access**

1. **Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://notion.so/my-integrations)**
2. **Click "New integration"**
3. **Name it** "ProgClub Website"
4. **Copy the Internal Integration Token**

## üóÑÔ∏è **Step 3: Get Database ID**

1. **Open your Events database** in Notion
2. **Copy the URL** - it looks like: `https://notion.so/workspace/1234567890abcdef...`
3. **Extract the database ID** (the long string after the last `/`)

## üîß **Step 4: Set Up GitHub Secrets**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. **Add these secrets:**

```
NOTION_TOKEN = your_integration_token_here
NOTION_DATABASE_ID = your_database_id_here
```

## üìù **Step 5: Test the Integration**

1. **Add a test event** in Notion:
   - Title: "Test Event"
   - Date: Today
   - Description: "This is a test"
   - Slug: "test-event"
   - Status: "Published"

2. **Trigger manual sync:**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
   - Click **"Sync Notion Content"**
   - Click **"Run workflow"**

3. **Check your website** - the event should appear!

## üéâ **Step 6: Train Club Officers**

### **How to Add Events:**

1. **Open Notion** (web or mobile app)
2. **Go to Events database**
3. **Click "+ New"**
4. **Fill in details:**
   - **Title:** "Python Workshop"
   - **Date:** 2025-01-22
   - **Description:** "Learn Python basics"

   - **Status:** "Published"
   - **Resources:** Select "Video", "Slides" if available
   - **ResourceURLs:** "https://youtube.com/..., https://docs.google.com/..."

5. **Save** - it will sync to website in 6 hours (or trigger manual sync)

## üîÑ **Automation**

- **Automatic sync:** Every 6 hours
- **Manual sync:** Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Sync Notion Content" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
- **Vercel deployment:** Automatic when content changes

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **Event not appearing:**
- Check Status is set to "Published"
- Verify slug is unique
- Check GitHub Actions for errors

### **Resources not showing:**
- Make sure ResourceURLs are in correct order (Video, Slides, Recording, Article)
- Check URLs are valid

### **Sync not working:**
- Verify GitHub secrets are set correctly
- Check Notion integration permissions
- Look at GitHub Actions logs

## üì± **Mobile Usage**

Club officers can use the **Notion mobile app** to:

## üéØ **Benefits**

Your sync script expects the following from your Notion table:

### How It Parses Resources and URLs

- **Resources:** Multi-select field (e.g., Video, Slides, Article, Recording)
- **ResourceURLs:** Rich text field, with each URL as a separate line (not a single comma-separated string)

#### In the script:
```js
const resources = properties.Resources?.multi_select || []
const resourceUrls = properties.ResourceURLs?.rich_text || []

const videoUrl = resourceUrls[0]?.plain_text || ''
const slidesUrl = resourceUrls[1]?.plain_text || ''
const recordingUrl = resourceUrls[2]?.plain_text || ''
const articleUrl = resourceUrls[3]?.plain_text || ''
```

**This means:**  
- The script expects each URL to be entered as a new line in the ResourceURLs field in Notion, not as a single comma-separated string.
- The order is:  
  1. Video  
  2. Slides  
  3. Recording  
  4. Article

---

## üü¢ How to Set Up Your Notion Database for Event Resources

1. **Keep the Resources column** (multi-select):
   - Add all resource types you want to show as buttons (e.g., Video, Slides, Article, Recording).
   - Select all that apply for each event.

2. **Use the ResourceURLs column** (rich text, key-value pairs):
   - For each resource, add a line in the format: `ResourceName: URL`
   - You can enter them in any order.
   - If a resource is selected in Resources but has no URL, leave it blank after the colon (e.g., `Slides:`) to show a "Coming Soon" button.

**Example:**

| Resources (multi-select) | ResourceURLs (key-value, any order)         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Video, Slides, Article   | Video: https://youtu.be/abc123              |
|                          | Slides:                                     |
|                          | Article: https://myblog.com/article         |

- This will show a Video button (with link), a Slides button (Coming Soon), and an Article button (with link).

**Step-by-step:**
1. Open Notion and go to your Events database.
2. Click "+ New" to add a new event.
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Title:** (e.g., "Python Workshop")
   - **Date:** (e.g., 2025-01-22)
   - **Description:** (e.g., "Learn Python basics")
   - **Slug:** (e.g., "python-workshop")
   - **Status:** (e.g., "Published")
   - **Resources:** Select all that apply (e.g., Video, Slides, Article)
   - **ResourceURLs:** For each resource, add a line: `ResourceName: URL` (leave blank after colon for Coming Soon)

**Notes:**
- Resource names are case-insensitive ("Video" and "video" are treated the same).
- You can add/remove resources as needed; the script will always match them up correctly.
- If you want to add more resource types, just add them to the Resources multi-select and use the same key in ResourceURLs.

## üü£ **Summary Table Example**

| Resources             | ResourceURLs (each on a new line)                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Video, Slides, Article| https://youtu.be/abc123<br>(blank)<br>(blank)<br>https://myblog.com/article |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**
- The order of the URLs must match: Video, Slides, Recording, Article.
- If you skip a resource, leave that line blank.

If you want to make this more flexible (e.g., not require blank lines), let me know and I can help you update the script!  
Otherwise, you‚Äôre good to go with this format.
